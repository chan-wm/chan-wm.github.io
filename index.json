A. fumigatus reproduces asexually by releasing conidia, a type of asexual spores that germinates into hyphae, into the atmosphere. These airborne conidia have a sufficiently small diameter of 2-3 μm to reach the lung alveoli and humans inhale several hundred conidia per day.\nInhalation of conidia can cause various illnesses depending on the immune status of the host. In immunocompetent individuals, there is rarely any adverse effect since the conidia are efficiently neutralised and eliminated by the immune system. However, in immunocompromised patients, it can cause life-threatening invasive aspergillosis (IA) where the conidia germinates into hyphae that invade the lungs and can spread rapidly to other parts of the body such as brain, heart and kidneys which can result in death.\nQuantification of fungal burden Quantifying fungal burden is important for tracking the disease progression and evaluating the effectiveness of the novel therapeutics. However, enumeration of fungal burden and extent of tissue invasion in histology images is still done manually, which is a tedious and time-consuming task and prone to error.\n","date":1657411200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657411200,"objectID":"c83e582e1201da8e07cb8bb1ecea0e8d","permalink":"https://chan.github.io/project/quantification-of-fungal-burden-in-histology-images/","publishdate":"2022-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/quantification-of-fungal-burden-in-histology-images/","section":"project","summary":"Using deep learning to quantify fungal burden in histology images","tags":["AI in Healthcare","Deep Learning","Computer Vision","Image Segmentation"],"title":"Quantification of fungal burden in histology images","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Welcome to Slides academia\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/img/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
